# EstelaLama_DataViz
This is a Data Visualization project we did on gun violence in the US.

We first went through EDA. We are working with 239,677 gun violence incidents in the United States, recorded from 1/1/2013 to 3/31/2018. 

We used various libraries like matplotlib and seaborn to answer the below business questions: 
1. Are gun deaths increasing over time?
2. Which type of gun is the most popular in shootings?
3. What gender are gun violence participants?
4. How old are gun violence participants?
5. Where do incidents occur most often?
6. Which are the top 15 states by deaths and injuries?
7. Which 100 cities have had the most deaths?
8. Which is the most dangerous state?
9. What cities in Illinois have most incidents happend?
10. What incidents happen in Chicago?
